### Welcome to the Hive!

<p>This project was a group production where each member used their own curiosities as fuel to find answers to complicated questions. Our original intent was to find a correlation between bee populations and crop production among commodities such as honey, almonds, and many other fruits dependent on bees for pollination. This question evolved into a breakdown of how bees are affected by climate change, colony collapse syndrome, and pesticides.</p>

<p>Note: This project is not taking into consideration wild bee populations, this is exclusively looking into USDA data provided by beekeepers across the United States. Certain states will be excluded due to inclimate weather or inhospitable habitats as bees are sensitive to temperatures exceeding 95 degrees and underneath 42 degrees. Weather also plays a factor, so not too hot, not too cold, not too wet and not too dry.</p>
